# Future of Innovation in Society high school aplications model
A simple AI-generated model of factors potentially affecting applications to the ASU FIS BS

This model was designed and created by the agentic AI Manus, then refined using ChatGPT and 03-mini-high.
The files here include background research on the ASU Future ofInnovation in Society BA, based predominantly on web-based material, background and framing documents created by Manus, and htlm/css/js files for the website

The model was tweaked and refined using ChatGPT to ensure functionality and calibrate predicted applications to within reasonable bounds (and so some of the information in the documentation doc (which was generated by Manus) is outdated. However, the model has not been validated against real-world data, apart from ensuring it is consistent with past application rates.

Past application rates were estimated from previous year enrollment.

While the model is not an accurate predictor of future enrollment, it is based on associations between a range of different factors and student enrollment, and provides insights into how these factors may potentially impact enrollment.
